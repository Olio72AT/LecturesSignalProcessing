A Series of lectures given at [ESIEE-Paris](http://www.esiee.fr), [ISBS-Paris](http://www.isbs.fr/), [ENSG](http://www.ensg.eu/)

by: J.-F. Bercher

We provide here the complete collection of Jupyter's notebooks, together with their html version and a [pdf ebook](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/LecturesSignalProcessing/master/tex/Poly.pdf).
Notebooks are located in the subdirectory `src` and not fully executed, while the html version in `html` corresponds to the full output. Beware that the notebooks make a heavy use of some Jupyter javascript extensions (e.g. latex_envs, exercise, ...) and unfortunately do not render correctly in nbviewer or in the github viewer ; that is the reason why we provide the static version in `./html`. See the install section below.

Unfortunately, conversion to html is not always perfect (certainly less than it used to), because of the issue reported [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/160). I will try to add a small workaround shortly. For the moment, please forgive bad renderings and refer to the notebook/pdf versions --> [pdf](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/LecturesSignalProcessing/master/tex/Poly.pdf).

## Installation
- Clone the repo as usual
- The notebooks use a bunch of nbextensions that you shall install. In particular, they need the latex_envs extension that enable to enter and display LaTeX environments. The best option is to install these extensions from the [IPython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions) repo. Follow the guidelines there. You may also install these extensions directly from here using:
```bash
	# Install jupyter extensions
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/latex_envs/master/latex_envs.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs  
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/master/highlighter.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable usability/highlighter/highlighter 
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/master/interactive_sols.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable usability/interactive_sols/interactive_sols 
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/master/exercise.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable usability/exercise/main 
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/master/exercise2.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable usability/exercise2/main 
	jupyter nbextension install https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/master/rubberband.zip  --user
	jupyter nbextension enable usability/rubberband/main 
```

This is an ongoing work and the maturity of the different chapters varies. Actually the first chapters are much less finalized that the later ones. Feel free to make corrections, add contents, examples, information. Your contribution will be most welcome (and acknowledged). You may do so by changing the files and submitting a pull request via the github interface.
